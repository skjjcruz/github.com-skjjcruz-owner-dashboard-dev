// DHQ skills — the methodology, published beside the tools.
//
// Each skill is DHQ's method for one kind of question, written for the
// member's AI to read before it answers: which tool to call, what the
// numbers mean, what decides the call, and what the answer must say.
// They are served as MCP prompts (prompts/list, prompts/get) and also as
// the `method` text inside the matching verdict tool's result, so an AI
// that never reads prompts still sees the method where it matters.
// The rules mirror the app's own code (Lineup screen, team assessor,
// player-action chain, Trade Center partner board, FAAB bid model).

Do not rebuild the lineup yourself, and don\'t tell the member to bench players who are already on the bench.',
      '2. The number is DHQ\'s weekly projection (its average week, the same number the app\'s Lineup screen ranks on) in this league\'s scoring; Sleeper\'s line stands in for anyone DHQ has no number for (`source` says which). A player Sleeper is not projecting this week reads 0 and cannot be started; every 0 says why (`zero_reason`: bye, out, doubtful, IR, no NFL team, no_sleeper_line, no_role).',
      '3. Out, IR, PUP, suspended and bye players cannot start. Doubtful counts as out. Questionable plays at his projection; a Questionable starter in a late game needs a pivot on the bench who plays as late (`questionable` names him).',
      '4. A player whose game has kicked off is locked where he is and counts his actual points. Never suggest moving a locked player.',
      '5. The solver fills the open slots for the most projected points: narrowest slots first, then an exact assignment check, so a player listed at two positions (DL and LB) is counted at both. No positional premium.',
      '6. Within 1.5 points or 10% is a coin flip: say so, then decide on health and news (the tiebreak: favored at 55%+ takes the higher floor, underdog at 45% or less the higher ceiling, an even game the higher projection).',
      '7. Then read latest_news and team_news for each player in the call. A new play-caller, a QB change, a teammate injury that frees targets, or a limited practice can move a coin flip; it does not overturn a gap of several points unless the player may not play.',

      '3. The going rate: a young starter (28 or under, 4,000+; in superflex a young starting QB) costs one headline piece: a NEXT-draft 1st, or a young player worth 70%+ of him. A 1st one draft further out only counts with a real add (a 2nd or a solid young player); a rebuilder won\'t take one two or more drafts away as the headliner, and for a young superflex QB a rebuilder also wants a 2nd or a solid young player on top.

Never propose an asset that is not in my_assets. `tough` means possible but costly or a stretch: never say a deal can\'t be done; lay out the realistic paths.
