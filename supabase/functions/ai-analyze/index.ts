TRADE RECOMMENDATION RULES (strictly enforce):
- Values are on a 0-10,000 scale. Only propose trades where combined values are within ~20% of each other.
- Never suggest offering a low-value player for a clearly higher-value target (e.g. do not offer a 1,500-value DB for a 4,000-value RB).
- Respect positional market rates: elite RBs and QBs command premium return; DBs, LBs, and depth pieces do not.
- A player with a high value (4,000+) is likely a borderline elite — do not frame them as depth or "cheap filler."
- Only recommend trades that a reasonable opposing owner would actually accept.

Provide:
**TEAM IDENTITY** — What type of contender/rebuilder/pretender is this? (2-3 sentences)
**CORE STRENGTHS** — What does this team do well? Name the specific players driving it
**CRITICAL WEAKNESSES** — Where are the real gaps? Be brutally honest
**DRAFT CAPITAL & FAAB** — Zero-pick years are a crisis. Pick-rich years are leverage. Assess accordingly and state what it means for their ability to add talent.
**TRADE OUTLOOK** — Buyer, seller, or holding? What should they target vs. deal away?
**TOP RECOMMENDED MOVES** — 2-3 specific, value-balanced trade ideas. For each: name the target, what to offer, why the other owner says yes.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
FANTASY FOOTBALL POSITIONAL RULES — READ FIRST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
This is a FANTASY FOOTBALL draft, not an NFL evaluation. Fantasy points come from OFFENSE only.

FANTASY SCORING POSITIONS (pick these):
  QB — Most scarce asset in dynasty. A team with no QB starter MUST address QB early.
  RB — Highest volume fantasy scorers. Always premium picks in rounds 1-2.
  WR — Deep receiver rooms needed. Strong round 1-3 value.
  TE — Premium TEs are elite assets; depth TEs are late picks.

NON-SCORING POSITIONS IN STANDARD LEAGUES (avoid early):
  LB, DL, DB, S, CB, EDGE, DEF — contribute NOTHING to fantasy scores in standard leagues.
${idpNote}

POSITIONAL DRAFT PRIORITY (strictly enforce unless DNA says otherwise):
  Round 1: QB / RB / WR — always. Never a defensive player in a standard league.
  Round 2: QB / RB / WR / TE — premium skill positions.
  Round 3+: TE depth, then positional needs, then long shots.

ROSTER NEEDS override DNA only when a position is flagged as a critical need:
  • If an owner's Needs include QB and a QB is available in the top 5 available players, they WILL take the QB unless their DNA (Value Drafter / Contrarian) specifically overrides it.
  • Never take a non-scoring position to fill a "need" — fantasy teams don't "need" LBs.

DNA DRAFT BEHAVIOR (apply AFTER positional rules above):
• Win Now       → Offensive starters only. Takes immediate contributors at QB/RB/WR who can start this season.
• Rebuilder     → Ceiling over floor. Comfortable with raw upside at any OFFENSIVE position.
• Value Drafter → Strict BPA among offensive players. Trusts rankings regardless of positional fit.
• Need Drafter  → Fills offensive roster gaps first. Will reach 3-5 spots for a critical QB/RB/WR need.
• Contrarian    → Picks offensive players ranked 8-15 spots below expectations. Fades popular consensus.
• Risk Averse   → Safe, proven college producers at skill positions. No boom-or-bust gambles.
• Aggressive    → Reaches 3-8 spots for high-upside offensive plays. Swings big on upside.
• Unknown       → Balanced BPA among offensive players with mild positional awareness.

CRITICAL SIMULATION RULES:
1. Each player can only be selected ONCE — track every pick and never repeat a player name
2. Process picks in the correct draft order based on DRAFT TYPE above
3. EVERY pick must reflect that specific owner's DNA profile applied WITHIN positional rules
4. Round 1 picks must ALWAYS be QB, RB, WR, or TE — no exceptions in standard leagues
5. A team with QB listed as a Need gets the top available QB within their DNA-adjusted range
6. The "reason" field must be 10-15 words referencing DNA behavior, positional need, or roster fit

Output ONLY a valid JSON array with no extra text, no markdown, no backticks:
[{"pick":1,"round":1,"slot":1,"owner":"Name","player":"Exact Player Name","pos":"WR","tier":1,"reason":"DNA-driven reason in exactly 10-15 words"},...]`;
