- Never suggest offering a low-value player for a clearly higher-value target (e.g. do not offer a 1,500-value DB for a 4,000-value RB).
- Respect positional market rates: elite RBs and QBs command premium return; DBs, LBs, and depth pieces do not.
- A player with a high value (4,000+) is likely a borderline elite — do not frame them as depth or "cheap filler."
- Only recommend trades that a reasonable opposing owner would actually accept.
- When analyzing another owner's team, all trade offers come FROM the requesting owner — never from the team being analyzed.

Provide:
**TEAM IDENTITY** — What type of contender/rebuilder/pretender is this? (2-3 sentences)
**CORE STRENGTHS** — What does this team do well? Name the specific players driving it

**DRAFT CAPITAL & FAAB** — Zero-pick years are a crisis. Pick-rich years are leverage. Assess accordingly and state what it means for their ability to add talent.
**TRADE OUTLOOK** — Buyer, seller, or holding? What should they target vs. deal away?

${slotsStr}

DRAFT DNA LABELS (derived from real owner pick history):
• QB-Hunter   → Has taken QB in round 1 historically
• QB-Hungry   → >15% of picks are QB
• RB-Heavy    → >38% of picks are RB
• WR-First    → >38% of picks are WR
• TE-Premium  → >15% of picks are TE
• DEF-Early   → Unusually takes defenders in R1-R2 (rare — >20% of their early picks)
• QB-Avoider  → Never or rarely drafts QB before round 4
• Balanced    → No strong positional bias
The "Round splits" line shows what each owner ACTUALLY drafts by round group across 3 seasons.
When Draft DNA conflicts with current Needs, current Needs take priority for critical gaps (0 starters at a position).

AVAILABLE PLAYERS (fantasy-ranked — #1 = highest fantasy value, defenders already deprioritized):
Players are ordered by fantasy scoring potential, not NFL draft consensus.
QB/RB/WR float to the top; EDGE/OLB rank above CB/S; CB/S/DL sink to the bottom of the pool.
Within the defender tier: EDGE = OLB > LB > CB > S > DL. Never pick a CB before a same-tier EDGE or OLB.
Pick from this list in order — #1 is the top remaining fantasy asset:

REAL NFL DRAFT BASELINE — ground your simulation here
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Across 2023, 2024, and 2025 NFL drafts (96 picks in rounds 1-2):
  • Only 9 of 96 picks (9%) were defenders — all were Edge rushers or OLBs
  • ZERO CBs, safeties, LBs, or DTs were taken in rounds 1-2
  • Across all rounds: ~32% of picks are defenders — but concentrated heavily in rounds 4-7

Dynasty fantasy owners mirror this behavior. In a realistic dynasty rookie draft:
  Round 1: 90%+ skill positions (QB/RB/WR/TE). A defender in round 1 is extremely rare.
  Round 2: 90%+ skill positions. The occasional EDGE rusher only in IDP leagues.
  Round 3-5: Mostly skill positions, a few EDGE/OLB may appear.
  Round 6+: Defenders become more common — up to 30-40% of late picks.
${idpNote}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FANTASY FOOTBALL POSITIONAL SCORING RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Fantasy points come from OFFENSE only in standard leagues.

SCORING POSITIONS (target these):
  QB  — Scarce. A team without a QB starter MUST address early.
  RB  — Premium volume scorer. Top RBs are always R1-R2 value.
  WR  — Receiver depth needed. Strong R1-R4 value.
  TE  — Elite TEs are assets; depth TEs are round 5+ picks.

NON-SCORING IN STANDARD LEAGUES (almost never draft before round 6):
  EDGE, LB, CB, S, DL — contribute zero to fantasy scores. Only valid early in IDP leagues.

ROUND-BY-ROUND POSITIONAL RULES (strictly enforce):
  Round 1: QB / RB / WR only. No defenders. No exceptions in standard leagues.
  Round 2: QB / RB / WR / TE. No defenders. EDGE only if owner is flagged DEF-Early AND it's IDP.
  Round 3-4: Skill positions. EDGE/OLB may appear if owner's round splits show it. If a defender IS taken, it must be EDGE or OLB — never CB, S, or DL before round 5.
  Round 5+: Any position is fair game, guided by owner's actual round-split profile.

CRITICAL: If an owner's "Round splits" show their R1-2 picks are 100% skill positions historically,
simulate them drafting 100% skill positions in rounds 1-2. Don't add defenders just to vary picks.

DNA DRAFT BEHAVIOR (apply AFTER positional rules above):
• Win Now       → Immediate contributors at QB/RB/WR who can start this season.
• Rebuilder     → Ceiling over floor. Raw upside at any OFFENSIVE position.
• Value Drafter → Strict BPA among offensive players. Trusts consensus rankings.
• Need Drafter  → Fills offensive roster gaps first. Reaches 3-5 spots for a critical need.
• Contrarian    → Takes offensive players ranked 8-15 spots below expectations.
• Risk Averse   → Safe college producers at skill positions. No boom-or-bust gambles.
• Aggressive    → Reaches 3-8 spots for high-upside offensive plays.
• Unknown       → Balanced BPA among offensive players with mild positional awareness.

CRITICAL SIMULATION RULES:
1. ★ QB FRANCHISE EMERGENCY — check this FIRST before every pick, overrides everything else:
   Look at the owner profile above. Does it say "🚨 QBs on roster: 0 — QB IS A FRANCHISE EMERGENCY"?
   OR does their Needs list include "QB(CRITICAL-0)"?
   If EITHER is true → this owner has ZERO quarterbacks. That is a dynasty-ending hole.

   RULE: An owner with 0 QBs MUST take the best available QB if one is ranked #1–5 in the current pool.
   This is NOT optional. It is NOT overridden by DNA. "RB-Heavy" DNA describes historical preference,
   not a license to skip the only position that cannot be ignored in dynasty.

   EXACT FAILING SCENARIO (you must get this right):
     Slot 1 owner: "🚨 QBs on roster: 0 — QB IS A FRANCHISE EMERGENCY"
     Available pool: #1 Ashton Jeanty (RB, Tier 1) | #2 Shedeur Sanders (QB, Tier 1)
     ✅ CORRECT pick: Shedeur Sanders (QB) — takes #2 over #1 because 0 QBs = emergency
     ❌ WRONG pick:   Ashton Jeanty (RB) — ignoring a zero-QB roster is a simulation failure
   The same owner then picks again at slot 2 (snake). With QB secured, they take the best remaining skill player.
   DNA and BPA apply normally to every pick AFTER the QB need is resolved.

2. Each player can only be selected ONCE — track every pick and never repeat a player name
3. Process picks in the correct draft order based on DRAFT TYPE above
4. EVERY pick must reflect that specific owner's DNA and round-split profile
5. Round 1: ONLY QB, RB, or WR — no TE, no defenders, in a standard league
6. Round 2: QB, RB, WR, or TE only — still no defenders in standard leagues
7. Use each owner's "Round splits" data as the primary guide for when they take each position type
8. The "reason" field must be 10-15 words referencing DNA behavior, positional need, or roster fit

Output ONLY a valid JSON array with no extra text, no markdown, no backticks:
[{"pick":1,"round":1,"slot":1,"owner":"Name","player":"Exact Player Name","pos":"WR","tier":1,"reason":"DNA-driven reason in exactly 10-15 words"},...]`;
